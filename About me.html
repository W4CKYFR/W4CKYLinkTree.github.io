    <p>So. I'm a 13 year old boy from finland. I like gaming, coding and sometimes, but rarely content making.
       I'm not going to share my real name for obvious reasons, but online I am called W4CKY or Wacky. I like to make my wild imagination come to life
       So that's mostly why I like learning to code (That's why this page exist's) Also I do acting and my dream is to be an actor so I thought I'd tell you that. I don't know why you are looking at this page, but I hope it's for something good.
       Anyways I don't have anything else to say so, have a great day/rest of your day
